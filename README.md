# hello-world

Hello humans and fellow programmers.

My name is Mario Abou Rached. I studied Mechatronics engineering during my undergrad, and currently Game Engineering at Newcastle University.

I like playing video games since I was 2 years old and ever since I turned 14 I wanted to be part of creating amazing and fun games.
I also watch F1, TV Shows, Movies? and anime.
